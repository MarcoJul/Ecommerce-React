# Ecommerce React app / Redux Test

Little e-commerce app coded using [Redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), simulating the behaviour of two mobile screens.

## General Usage

The menu data is fetched from a list of dummy element (can be easily connected to a database server).

All the different state datas are managed by Redux (Toolkit).

In the menu, you can add plates to cart, and after adding, modify the quantity if necessary.

Both in menu and in the cart if the quantity of one plates is 1, removing another plate will remove the single plate from the cart.
